/*
Press play to start the scene. The "TelemetryTester" GameObject has a single component on it.
In the context menu, you can see there are "Start" and "Stop".
Pressing "Start" will begin polling at a rate of 1 request/sec. The MonoBehaviour will print 
 results to the Unity Log.
It is best to press "Stop" before stopping the scene.
See the screenshot in this directory to see what is meant by "context menu."

Please ensure that you have started the BackEnd service before running this, or else there will be 
 nothing to request telemetry data from.
